// Engine: the emulated G1 with nothing around it. A ROM goes in, the factory OS is installed in
// its flash, and from there whoever owns it decides how the flash is kept, where the MIDI comes
// from, where the audio goes and how fast it runs: EmuHost (console and window) against the wall
// clock, the plugin against the DAW's audio blocks. It opens no device, starts no thread of its own
// (the DSP workers are the Microcontroller's) and writes no file.
//
// The flash holds the installed OS, which is the ROM's code, and the user's patches and settings.
// A plugin keeps its G1 inside the DAW project, which may travel, so what it saves is userState():
// only the bytes that differ from the factory flash this ROM produces. The OS never leaves the
// machine that has the ROM; restoring needs the same ROM, which the state names by a hash.
