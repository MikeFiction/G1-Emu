// EmuHost: the emulated G1 running, with everything around it: the flash on disk, the ALSA
// MIDI ports (PC Port and MIDI), the audio (JACK or ALSA) and real-time pacing, on a thread
// of its own. Used by the console (g1run) and the window (g1gui).
//
// What it uses is in Options: the window sets them from its settings panel and g1run leaves them
// at their defaults. The G1_* environment variables still win over both, so scripts and the test
// bench keep working: G1_AUDIO (jack, alsa, an ALSA device or no), G1_GAIN_DB (+36 by default),
// G1_JACK_CONNECT=0, G1_RAWMIDI (the ID of the snd-virmidi card to take over, G1Emu by default;
// 0 disables it), G1_RECORD=seconds (4-channel WAV next to the flash), G1_PCPORT_OUT/G1_PCPORT_IN/
// G1_MIDI_OUT/G1_MIDI_IN (manual MIDI device names, see Options::pcPortOutDevice). G1_THREADS and
// G1_INTERP are debugging knobs of the emulator core and stay environment-only.
