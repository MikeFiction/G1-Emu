// Runner: an Engine driven by a DAW's audio blocks instead of the wall clock.
//
// A worker thread keeps the emulator exactly `latency()` frames ahead of what the host has taken,
// and stops there. The audio callback only takes finished frames out of a lock-free ring: it never
// runs the emulator, never locks and never waits (except when rendering offline, where waiting is
// the point). The latency is reported to the host, which delays everything else to match.
//
// Because the emulator never gets further ahead than that, a MIDI event at offset o of the block
// that starts at host frame C can be given to the G1 at exactly frame C + latency + o of its
// output: the notes land where the DAW put them, shifted by the reported latency, whatever the
// block size. (Then the G1's MIDI IN takes its 1 ms per three bytes, like the hardware.)
//
// If the worker falls behind anyway, the callback puts out silence for the missing frames and
// throws their late copies away when they arrive, so the timing stays locked to the host.
